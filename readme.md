-----

## Requirements
- Docker 19.03.12+
- Docker Compose 1.26.2+
- Python 3.6+
- Pip
- Unix OS

-----

## Installation
In the project's root, run `./install.sh` to install the Minipresto CLI. If you
encounter errors during installation, run `sudo -H ./install.sh -v`.

-----

## CLI
Minipresto is built with [Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/), a
popular, open-source toolkit used to build Python-based CLIs.

Minipresto commands are documented below. Note that many command options can be
specified with a shorthand alternative, which is the first letter of each
option, i.e. `--catalog` can be `-c`.

### Provisioning Environments
You can provision an environment via the `provision` command.

- `provision`: Executes a `docker-compose` command and brings up an environment. 
  - `--catalog`: Catalog module to provision. Can be none, one, or many.
  - `--security`: Security module to provision. Can be none, one, or many.
  - `--env`: Add or override environment variables. If any of the variables
    overlap with variables in the library's `.env` file or the `minipresto.cfg`
    file, the variable will be overridden with what is provided in `--env`. Can
    be none, one, or many.
  - `--no-rollback`: Will not rollback provisioned resources in the event of an
    error. Defaults to `False`.
  - `--docker-native`: Appends the constructed Compose command with native
    Docker Compose CLI options. Can be none, one, or many. To use this, simply
    pass in additional Docker Compose options, i.e. `minipresto provision
    --docker-native '--remove-orphans --force-recreate'` or `minipresto
    provision -d --build`. 
    - When passing multiple parameters to this option, the list needs to be
      space-delimited and surrounded with double or single quotes.
- If no options are passed in, the CLI will provision a standalone Presto
  container.
- The command cannot currently be used to append additional modules to an active
  environment. To modify an environment, first shut it down, then re-provision
  with the needed modules.

Sample `provision` commands:

```bash
minipresto provision --catalog hive-hms --catalog elasticsearch --security ldap --docker-native '--build --force-recreate'
minipresto provision -c hive-hms -c elasticsearch -s ldap
minipresto provision --env STARBURST_VER=332-e.6
```

This command constructs a Docker Compose command and executes it in the host
shell. The commands look like:

```bash
ENV_VAR_1=SOMETHING ENV_VAR_2=SOMETHING ENV_VAR_3=${ENV_VAR_3} ... \
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml \
  -f modules/catalog/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml \
  -f modules/catalog/hive-hms/hive-hms.yml \
  -f modules/security/ldap/ldap.yml \
  up -d
```

Using the structure of the Minipresto library, it is able to merge multiple
Docker Compose files together.

#### Using Licensed Starburst Features
Note that if you are using licensed features, you will need to provide a path to
a valid Starburst license. This can be set via `minipresto config` or provided
via the `--env` option at command runtime. The variable for this is
`STARBURST_LIC_PATH`. 

Additionally, you need to uncomment the volume mount in the library's root
`docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
  # Uncomment this to enable the volume mount. The variable should point to a
  # valid SEP license. 
  volumes:
    - "${STARBURST_LIC_PATH}:/usr/lib/presto/etc/starburstdata.license:ro"
```

### Removing Resources
You can remove resources with the `remove` command.

- `remove`: Removes any persistent resources associated with Minipresto
  environments. If no options are selected, **all** Minipresto resources are
  removed.
  - `--images`: Limit the removal to Minipresto images. 
  - `--volumes`: Limit the removal to Minipresto volumes. 
  - `--label`: Target a specific label for removal (requires a valid key-value
    pair). Can be used in combination with other options. Can be none, one, or
    many. Each label will be treated as a separate target for removal. 
  - `--force`: Forces the removal of Minipresto resources. Defaults to `False`.
- Named volumes tied to any *existing* container cannot be forcibly removed,
  neither by Minipresto nor by the Docker CLI.
- Images tied to stopped containers can be forcibly removed, but any image tied
  to a running container cannot be forcibly removed, neither by Minipresto nor
  by the Docker CLI.

Sample `remove` command:

```bash
minipresto -v remove --volumes --label com.starburst.tests.module.postgres=catalog-postgres --force
```

This will only remove volumes associated to the Postgres catalog module.

### Shutting Down Environments
You can shut down an active environment with the `down` command.

- `down`: Stops and removes all running Minipresto containers (exactly what
  `docker-compose down` does).
  - `--keep`: Prevents the removal of containers. With this flag, containers
    will only be stopped, preserving any unnamed container volumes (therefore
    keeping filesystem changes). Defaults to `False`.

Sample `down` command:

```bash
minipresto -v down
```

### Taking Environment Snapshots
You can capture snapshots for both active and inactive environments with the
`snapshot` command. 

- `snapshot`: Creates a tarball of the resources required to recreate an
  environment. This can apply to active environments where the running modules'
  files are collected. It can also apply to an inactive environment where the
  modules are specified with the `--catalog` and `--security` options. The
  tarball is placed in the library's `snapshots/` directory by default.
  - `--name`: Name of the resulting tarball file (required). Name must consist
    of alphanumeric, hyphen, and underscore characters.
  - `--catalog`: Catalog module to snapshot. Can be none, one, or many. If
    provided, active resources will not be captured in the snapshot.
  - `--security`: Security module to snapshot. Can be none, one, or many. If
    provided, active resources will not be captured in the snapshot.
  - `--directory`: Directory to save the resulting snapshot file in. Defaults to
    the snapshots directory in the Minipresto library.
  - `--force`: Override a check to see if the resulting snapshot file already
    exists. Defaults to `False`.
  - `--no-scrub`: Overrides the default behavior of scrubbing sensitive data
    (access keys and passwords) from the user's `minipresto.cfg` file. Defaults
    to `False`.
- Minipresto records the original `provision` command and places it in the
  snapshot file as `provision-snapshot.sh`; this can be directly executed. This
  makes it easier for others to reuse the environment and provision it
  identically.

Sample `snapshot` commands:

```bash
# Take a snapshot of an active environment (this will create a tarball 
# called `snapshot-t2533.tar.gz` in the library's `snapshots/` directory):
minipresto snapshot --name t-2533

# Take a snapshot of an inactive environment
minipresto snapshot -n super-sweet-env -c hive-hms -c elasticsearch -s ldap
```

### Manage Configuration
You can manage Minipresto configuration with the `config` command. 

- `config`: Manages configuration. Executing the command opens an existing
  configuration file for edits or creates a templated configuration file if it
  doesn't already exist. The text editor defaults to your shell's default, but
  this can be changed via the `TEXT_EDITOR` config.
  - `--reset`: Recreates the user home `~/.minipresto/` directory and creates a
    templated configuration file. Defaults to `False`.

### Top-Level CLI Options
You can get help, enable verbose output, and change the runtime library
directory for any command. 

- `--help`: Displays a help menu for a specific command or for the entire CLI. 
- `--verbose`: Logs verbose output. Can be useful for debugging purposes.
- `--lib-path`: Changes the library directory for the command.

```bash
# Get overall help
minipresto --help

# Get command-specific help
minipresto [COMMAND] --help

# Enable verbose output
minipresto --verbose [COMMAND] # -v works as well
```

### Minipresto Library
Minipresto should always point to a compatible library with the expected
structure. The library directory can be set one of three ways, listed below in
the order of precedence:

1. The `--lib-dir` CLI option sets the library directory for the current
   command.
2. The `minipresto.cfg` configuration file sets the library directory via the
   `LIB_PATH` config. 
3. The CLI source code is used to set the library directory and assumes the
   project is being run out of a cloned repository.

If you not running out of a cloned repository, it is advisable to provide a
pointer to the library in Minipresto's configuration via the `LIB_PATH` config.

### Environment Variables
Environment variables are passed to the Docker Compose files through two
sources. The first is from the `.env` file in the library root. These variables
define the versions of the provisioned Docker services.

Environment variables can also be passed to Docker Compose files from variables
set in the `[MODULES]` section of the `minipresto.cfg` file. These can contain
sensitive information like access credentials, so their values are intentionally
left out of library files.

Any existing Docker Compose environment variable can be overridden with the
`provision` command's `--env` option, and any unset variable can be set with it.

### Minipresto Configuration File
Permanent configuration is set in `~/.minipresto/minipresto.cfg`. The sections
in this file each serve a separate purpose. Minipresto can function with none of
these configs set, but if you are not running out of a cloned repository, you
will need to point it to a valid library.

#### [CLI] Section
These configs allow the user to customize the behavior of Minipresto. 

- LIB_PATH: The filesystem path of the Minipresto library (specifically to the
  `lib/` directory).
- TEXT_EDITOR: The text editor to use with the `config` command, e.g. "vi",
  "nano", etc. Defaults to the shell's default editor.

#### [DOCKER] Section
These configs allow the user to customize how Minipresto uses Docker.

- DOCKER_HOST: A URL pointing to an accessible Docker host. This is
  automatically detected by Docker otherwise.

#### [PRESTO] Section
These configs allow the user to set global Presto configuration. Since many
modules can append to Presto's core files, the supported way to make global
changes to these files is with these configs.

- STARBURST_LIC_PATH: Required if using licensed Starburst Enterprise Presto
  features. It can point to any valid license on your filesystem.
- CONFIG: Configuration for Presto's `config.properties` file. 
- JVM_CONFIG: Configuration for Presto's `jvm.config` file.

A multiline example of this section:

```
[PRESTO]
CONFIG=
    query.max-memory-per-node=500MB
    query.max-total-memory-per-node=500MB
JVM_CONFIG=
    -Dsun.security.krb5.debug=true
```

#### [MODULES] Section
This section sets environment variables passed to containers provisioned by
Minipresto. Environment variables are only set in a container if it is specified
in the relevant `docker-compose.yml` file. This supports Presto secrets.

- S3_ENDPOINT
- S3_ACCESS_KEY
- S3_SECRET_KEY
- AWS_REGION
- SNOWFLAKE_DIST_CONNECT_URL
- SNOWFLAKE_DIST_CONNECT_USER
- SNOWFLAKE_DIST_CONNECT_PASSWORD
- SNOWFLAKE_DIST_WAREHOUSE
- SNOWFLAKE_DIST_DB
- SNOWFLAKE_DIST_STAGE_SCHEMA
- SNOWFLAKE_JDBC_CONNECT_URL
- SNOWFLAKE_JDBC_CONNECT_USER
- SNOWFLAKE_JDBC_CONNECT_PASSWORD
- SNOWFLAKE_JDBC_WAREHOUSE
- SNOWFLAKE_JDBC_DB
- SNOWFLAKE_JDBC_STAGE_SCHEMA

## Project Structure 
The library is built around Docker Compose files and utilizes Docker's ability
to [extend Compose files](https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/#multiple-compose-files).

The Starburst Presto service is defined in a Compose file at the library root,
and all other services look up in the directory tree to reference the parent
Presto service. In Compose files, the fully-qualified path––relative to the
library's root `docker-compose.yml` file––must be provided for Docker to locate
resources.

An abbreviated library structure:

```
lib
├── Dockerfile
├── docker-compose.yml
├── modules
│   ├── catalog
│   │   ├── postgres
│   │   │   ├── postgres.yml
│   │   │   ├── readme.md
│   │   │   └── resources
│   │   │       ├── postgres
│   │   │       │   └── postgres.env
│   │   │       └── presto
│   │   │           └── postgres.properties
│   │   ├── elasticsearch
│   │   │   ├── elasticsearch.yml
│   │   │   ├── readme.md
│   │   │   └── resources
│   │   │       ├── bootstrap
│   │   │       │   └── bootstrap-elasticsearch.sh
│   │   │       └── presto
│   │   │           └── elasticsearch.properties
│   ├── resources
│   └── security
└── snapshots
```

And the contents of a `docker-compose.yml` file (`postgres.yml`):

```yaml
version: "3.7"
services:

  presto:
    volumes:
      - "./modules/catalog/postgres/resources/presto/postgres.properties:/usr/lib/presto/etc/catalog/postgres.properties"

  postgres:
    image: "postgres:${POSTGRES_VER}"
    container_name: "postgres"
    labels:
      - "com.starburst.tests=minipresto"
      - "com.starburst.tests.module.postgres=catalog-postgres"
    env_file:
      - "./modules/catalog/postgres/resources/postgres/postgres.env"
```

Notice that the mounted volume is not relative to the
`lib/modules/catalog/postgres/` directory––it is relative to the parent
directory which houses the top-level `docker-compose.yml` file. Also, notice the
label––this label will be used to identify resources related to testing suite so
that the client commands actually work.

### Presto Dockerfile
Minipresto modifies the Starburst Presto Docker image by adding the Presto CLI
to the image as well as by providing `sudo` to the `presto` user. This is
required for certain bootstrap scripts (i.e. using `yum` to install packages in
a Presto container for a module). This image is compatible with Starburst Presto
images back to Starburst Presto version `332-e.0`.

-----

## Adding New Modules (Tutorial)
Adding new modules is relatively simple, but there are a few important
guidelines to follow to ensure compatibility with the Minipresto CLI. The design
rules are the same for both catalogs and security modules. The best way to
demonstrate this process is through a tutorial. The example below demonstrates
the process of creating a new catalog module for Postgres.

### Create the Relevant Directory
Create the module's directory in the `lib/modules/catalog/` directory:

```sh
mkdir lib/modules/catalog/postgres/
cd lib/modules/catalog/postgres/
```

### Add Presto Resources 
All resources for a module go inside of a `resources/` directory within the
module. Inside this directory, place Presto-specific resources into a `presto/`
directory, then mount the resources to the Presto service defined in the root
`docker-compose.yml` file. 

```sh
mkdir -p resources/presto/
```

In the newly-created `presto/` directory, add a properties file.

```sh
bash -c "cat << EOF > postgres.properties
connector.name=postgresql
connection-url=jdbc:postgresql://postgres:5432/minipresto
connection-user=admin
connection-password=prestoRocks15
EOF"
```

**Note**: Passwords should always be `prestoRocks15` for consistency. 

### Add the Docker Compose YAML
In `lib/modules/catalog/postgres/`, add a Docker Compose file:

```sh
touch postgres.yml
```

Notice the naming convention––`postgres.yml`. Giving the same root name of
"postgres" to both the parent directory `postgres/` and to the Docker Compose
file `postgres.yml` will allow Minipresto to find our new catalog module when it
is provisioned. 

Next, add an environment file for the Postgres service. Non-Presto resources
should go into their own directory, so create one for postgres:

```sh
mkdir resources/postgres/
```

In the newly-created directory, add an environment file which will register the
variables in the Postgres container when spun up:

```sh
bash -c "cat << EOF > postgres.env
POSTGRES_USER=admin
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=prestoRocks15
POSTGRES_DB=minipresto
EOF"
```

This file will initialize Postgres with a database Minipresto, a user `presto`,
and a password `prestoRocks15`.

### Review Progress 
The resulting directory tree should look like this (from the `/modules/catalog/`
directory):

```
postgres
├── postgres.yml
└── resources
    ├── postgres
    │   └── postgres.env
    └── presto
        └── postgres.properties
```

### Configure the Docker Compose YAML File
We will now define the `postgres.yml` Docker Compose file. Set it up as follows,
and **read the important notes after**:

```yaml
version: "3.7"
services:

  presto:
    volumes:
    # Always place Presto files in `/usr/lib/presto/etc/` as symbolic links can change between versions
      - "./modules/catalog/postgres/resources/presto/postgres.properties:/usr/lib/presto/etc/catalog/postgres.properties"

  postgres:
    image: "postgres:${POSTGRES_VER}"
    container_name: "postgres"
    labels:
      - "com.starburst.tests=minipresto"
      - "com.starburst.tests.module.postgres=catalog-postgres"
    env_file:
      - "./modules/catalog/postgres/resources/postgres/postgres.env"

```

### Important Implementation Details: Paths and Labels
We can observe a few things about the Compose file we just defined.

#### Path References for Volumes and Build Contexts
First, the volumes we mount *are not relative to the Compose file itself*, they
are relative to the base `docker-compose.yml` file in the project root. The same
goes for build contexts, such as the one in the Elasticsearch Compose file. This
is because the CLI extends Compose files, meaning that all path references in
sub-Compose files need to be relative to the positioning of the parent Compose
file. The base Compose file is determined when you execute a Docker Compose
command––the first Compose file referenced in the command becomes the base file,
and that happens to be the `docker-compose.yml` file in the project root. This
is how the Minipresto constructs these commands. 

If this is confusing, you can read more about it on the [Docker
docs](https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/#multiple-compose-files). 

#### Minipresto Docker Labels
Secondly, notice how we applied sets of labels to the Postgres service. These
labels tell the CLI which resources to target when executing commands. In
general, there is no need to apply a label to the Presto service since it is
already applied in the base Compose file **unless** the module is an extension
of the Presto service––see the notes below. Labels should always be applied to:

- Docker services (AKA the resulting container)
- Named volumes
- Images built from a Dockerfile

Labels should be defined in pairs of two. The convention is:

- The standard Minipresto resource label: `com.starburst.tests=minipresto`
- A module-specific resource label:
  `com.starburst.tests.module.<module-name>=<module-type>-<module-name>`
  - For this label, the `module-type` should be either `catalog` or `security`

The second label is used by both the `snapshot` and `remove` CLI commands.
`snapshot` will read the `catalog-<module-name>` or `security-<module-name>` and
limit its extract to those modules' directories. The naming convention for this
label is as follows:

In Compose files where multiple services are defined, all services should be
labeled with the same label sets (see `hive-hms.yml` for an example).

In general, we always want to apply labels to:

- Images that are built by Dockerfiles (see the root `docker-compose.yml` file)
- Services/containers defined in Docker Compose files 
- Named volumes defined in Docker Compose files

-----

**Note**: A named volume is defined explicitly in the Compose file, and these
should always have label sets applied to them. Below is an example of the
Compose file we just created with a named volume.

-----

```yaml
version: "3.7"
services:

  presto:
    volumes:
      - "./modules/catalog/postgres/resources/presto/postgres.properties:/usr/lib/presto/etc/catalog/postgres.properties"

  postgres:
    image: "postgres:${POSTGRES_VER}"
    container_name: "postgres"
    labels: # These labels are applied to the service/container
      - "com.starburst.tests=minipresto"
      - "com.starburst.tests.module.postgres=catalog-postgres"
    env_file:
      - "./modules/catalog/postgres/resources/postgres/postgres.env"

volumes:
  postgres-data:
    labels: # These labels are applied to the named volume
      - "com.starburst.tests=minipresto"
      - "com.starburst.tests.module.postgres=catalog-postgres"
```

-----

**Note**: Certain modules will only extend the parent Presto service and do not
actually define any new services/containers. See the Snowflake catalog modules
for an example of this. For these modules, the only label requirement is to add
the standard, module-specific label sets to the Presto service in the relevant
`docker-compose.yml` file 

-----

### Test the New Catalog
We are all finished up. We can test our new catalog through the Minipresto CLI:

```sh
minipresto provision --catalog postgres
```

We can now shell into the `presto` container and run some tests:

```
docker exec -it presto bash 
presto-cli
presto> show catalogs;
```

### Customizing Images
If you need to build a custom image, you can do so and structure the Compose
file accordingly. See the library's root `docker-compose.yml` file for an
example of this.

### Bootstrap Scripts
Minipresto supports container bootstrap scripts. These scripts **do not
replace** the entrypoint (or default command) for a given container. The script
is copied from the Minipresto library to the container, executed, and then
removed from the container. Containers are restarted after each bootstrap script
execution, **so the bootstrap scripts themselves should not restart the
container's service**.

If a bootstrap script has already executed in a container *and* the unnamed
volume associated with the container still exists, Minipresto will not
re-execute the bootstrap script *unless the contents of the script have
changed*. The is useful after running `minipresto down --keep` (which does not
remove unnamed container volumes), so that the subsequent provisioning command
will not re-execute the same bootstrap script(s).

If a bootstrap script is updated, it is recommended to destroy the associated
container(s) via `minipresto down` and then to re-provision.

To add a bootstrap script, add a `resources/bootstrap/` directory in any given
module, create a shell script, and then reference the script name in the Compose
YAML file:

```yaml
version: "3.7"
services:

  presto:
    environment:
      MINIPRESTO_BOOTSTRAP: "bootstrap.sh"
```

### Managing Presto's `config.properties` File
Many modules can change the Presto `config.properties` and `jvm.config` files.
Because of this, there are two supported ways to modify these files with
Minipresto.

The first way is by setting the `CONFIG` variable in your `minipresto.cfg` file.
This is intended to set global Presto configuration that will be present for any
module. Generally speaking, this can be used for any type of configuration (i.e.
memory configuration) that is not likely to be modified by any module. This also
applies to the `jvm.config` file, which has identical support via the
`JVM_CONFIG` variable. 

To set these variables, your configuration file should
look like:

```
[PRESTO]
CONFIG=
    query.max-memory-per-node=500MB
    query.max-total-memory-per-node=500MB
JVM_CONFIG=
    -Dsun.security.krb5.debug=true
```

The second way to modify core Presto configuration is via bootstrap scripts.
This method is utilized by modules that need to make module-specific changes to
Presto files. An example bootstrap snippet can be found below:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -euxo pipefail

echo "Adding Presto configs..."
cat <<EOT >> /usr/lib/presto/etc/config.properties
query.max-stage-count=105
query.max-execution-time=1h
EOT
```
